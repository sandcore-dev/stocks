# Stock exchange administration

*This is a work in progress.*

An application to maintain a stock exchange ledger.

Since this application is used privately, there is no per-user administration.
Everyone with a login will have access to all data.

Therefore, there is no way to register or to retrieve lost passwords.
User administration is done through Tinker.
